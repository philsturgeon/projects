# Crowd Funding

Direct funding for biodiverstiy and carbon sequestration projects for Protect Earth and anyone else who wants to use this open-source software.

This repo is a placeholder whilst we get our plan together. Here are the goals.

## Goals

1. Help any charity setup crowd funding and direct sponsorship for projects
   which otherwise would not get the support.

2. Easy stack to deploy for anyone, using Laravel PHP and Laravel Vapor with
   minimal dependencies.

3. Stripe for Payments.

4. Any email provider with just config.

5. Stores photos of the work thats about to be done.

6. Allows for updates of work after its done, emailing out updates to project
   subscribers.

7. User profiles where anyone can see projects they have funded.

8. Businesses or individuals can help fund.

This is a tall order but we'll keep everything MVP and keep iterating.
